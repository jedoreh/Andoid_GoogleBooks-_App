# Andoid_GoogleBooks-_App

This android app was done while watching the video https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=android-studio-connected-app-building-first&author=simone-alessandria&name=android-studio-connected-app-building-first-m2&clip=0&mode=live

I need help I do not know why the app runs on Nexus 5 AVD and on Pixel 2 AVD is complaining of Host not resolved (www.googleapis.com)
